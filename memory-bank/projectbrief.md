# NodeUI Project Brief

## Project Overview
NodeUI is a web-based node graph interface implementation that allows users to create, connect, and manipulate various types of nodes in a visual graph environment. The project focuses on providing a flexible and interactive user interface for node-based workflows.

## Core Requirements

### Functionality
1. Interactive node graph visualization
2. Multiple node types support (Base, Group, Log, Routing, Settings)
3. Edge connection management between nodes
4. Context menu system for node operations
5. Properties panel for node configuration
6. Event handling system
7. Database integration for persistence
8. Logging system for operations

### Technical Requirements
1. Pure vanilla JavaScript implementation
2. Modern HTML5 and CSS3
3. No external dependencies
4. Browser-based operation
5. Responsive and performant UI

## Project Goals
1. Create a lightweight yet powerful node graph interface
2. Provide intuitive user interaction for node manipulation
3. Ensure extensibility for adding new node types
4. Maintain clean separation of concerns in code structure
5. Implement robust event handling and state management

## Success Criteria
1. Smooth node creation and connection workflow
2. Responsive UI with no performance bottlenecks
3. Reliable data persistence
4. Intuitive context menu operations
5. Clear visual feedback for user actions

## Constraints
1. Vanilla JavaScript only - no frameworks
2. Browser-based implementation
3. Modern web standards compliance
4. Clean, maintainable code structure
