# Product Context

## Purpose
NodeUI exists to provide a flexible, lightweight solution for creating and managing node-based visual workflows in web applications. It addresses the need for a framework-independent node graph interface that can be easily integrated into any web project.

## Problems Solved
1. **Visual Workflow Creation**: Enables users to create complex workflows through visual node connections
2. **Dynamic Configuration**: Provides a flexible way to configure node properties and behaviors
3. **State Management**: Handles complex state management for node graphs without external libraries
4. **User Interaction**: Simplifies complex user interactions into intuitive operations
5. **Data Persistence**: Manages saving and loading of graph states

## User Experience Goals

### Core User Flows
1. **Node Creation**
   - Quick access to node types through context menu
   - Intuitive placement in the workspace
   - Clear visual feedback

2. **Node Connection**
   - Simple edge creation between nodes
   - Visual feedback for valid/invalid connections
   - Easy edge manipulation

3. **Node Configuration**
   - Accessible properties panel
   - Real-time property updates
   - Type-specific configuration options

4. **Graph Management**
   - Save/load graph states
   - Group operations on nodes
   - Workspace navigation

### User Interface Principles
1. **Clarity**: Clear visual hierarchy and node relationships
2. **Responsiveness**: Immediate feedback for user actions
3. **Consistency**: Uniform interaction patterns across features
4. **Efficiency**: Minimize clicks for common operations
5. **Flexibility**: Support for different use cases and workflows
