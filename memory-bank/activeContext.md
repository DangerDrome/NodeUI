# Active Context

## Current Focus
The current focus is on performance optimization and stability improvements for the `ThreeJSNode`. Recent work has focused on eliminating flickering and improving rendering performance in the 3D viewport.

## Recent Changes
- **Performance Optimizations**: Implemented comprehensive optimizations to reduce flickering and improve rendering performance in the `ThreeJSNode`.
- **Conditional Animation Loop**: Added intelligent animation loop management that only runs when needed (during interaction or timeline playback).
- **Render Optimization**: Implemented `needsRender` flag system to prevent unnecessary renders when the scene is static.
- **Timeline Performance**: Replaced `setTimeout` with `requestAnimationFrame` for smoother timeline playback and better synchronization.
- **CSS Optimizations**: Added GPU acceleration and canvas optimization CSS properties to reduce layout thrashing.
- **Renderer Optimizations**: Enhanced WebGL renderer settings with performance-focused configurations including power preference and pixel ratio capping.

## Active Decisions
- Animation loops should only run when actively needed to conserve resources and prevent flickering.
- Render calls should be minimized through intelligent state tracking.
- Timeline playback should use `requestAnimationFrame` for better performance and synchronization.
- CSS optimizations are essential for smooth 3D rendering performance.
- WebGL renderer should be configured for high-performance mode with appropriate feature toggles.

## Next Steps
- Implement loading of 3D model formats (e.g., FBX, glTF, Alembic) into the `ThreeJSNode`.
- Expose properties from the 3D scene (e.g., camera position, object transforms) as connectable attributes on the node.
- Enhance the timeline with keyframing capabilities.
- Consider implementing scene graph management for complex 3D scenes.

## Known Issues
- The timeline is currently a simple frame counter and does not yet affect the 3D scene.
- No 3D content can be loaded into the scene yet; it only contains the default helpers.
- Performance optimizations are complete and flickering has been significantly reduced.

## Current Status
- **Project**: ThreeJSNode Performance Optimization
- **Phase**: Performance Optimization Complete
- **Progress**: 100% - The `ThreeJSNode` now provides smooth, flicker-free 3D rendering with optimized performance.
