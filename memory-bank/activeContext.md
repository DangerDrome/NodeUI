# Active Context

## Current Focus
The NodeUI refactoring is **fully complete and stabilized**. The architecture has been further improved by merging `DragHandler` and `SelectionManager` into `InteractionHandler`, consolidating all user interaction, selection, and drag logic into a single handler. All references to the old `dragHandler` have been removed, and drag functionality is fully restored and tested.

## Recent Changes
- **Merged DragHandler and SelectionManager into InteractionHandler**
- **All drag and selection logic now handled by InteractionHandler**
- **Removed all references to dragHandler**
- **Fixed and verified drag functionality**
- **Maintained all previous features and user interactions**

## Active Decisions
- Continue to use a single, consolidated handler for all user interactions
- Maintain clear delegation and separation for rendering, file, context menu, and node management

## Next Steps
- Monitor for any further edge cases
- Continue documenting the new architecture
- Plan for new features and optimizations

## Known Issues
- None. All core features, including drag and selection, are working as intended.

## Current Status
- **Project**: NodeUI Refactor - **COMPLETE & STABLE**
- **Phase**: Maintenance
- **Progress**: 100% - All functionality preserved and improved
