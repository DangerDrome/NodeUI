# Active Context

## Current Focus
The project is currently in its initial setup and organization phase. After establishing the memory bank for documentation, we're now improving the codebase organization by using more semantically appropriate naming conventions (e.g., `nodes` instead of `graph` for node-related components).

## Recent Changes
1. Created memory bank structure
2. Documented project architecture and requirements
3. Established technical context and constraints
4. Set up project organization and guidelines
5. Renamed `js/graph` folder to `js/nodes` for better semantic clarity
   - Updated all file references in index.html
   - Verified file accessibility and paths
   - Tested file serving functionality
6. Removed redundant files
   - Deleted empty `properties.js` skeleton file
   - Deleted unused `ui.js` documentation stub
   - Updated index.html and documentation accordingly
7. Improved code organization
   - Created `js/core` folder for core system modules
   - Moved `nodeui.js`, `events.js`, and `database.js` to core folder
   - Updated file references and documentation
8. Removed redundant logging system
   - Deleted `logs.js` as its functionality is better handled by `lognode.js`
   - Removed references from index.html and documentation
   - Consolidated logging functionality in the node system
9. Further core system organization
   - Moved `contextmenu.js` to core folder
   - Updated file references in index.html
   - Updated documentation to reflect core UI component status
10. Modern project structure
    - Renamed `js` directory to `src`
    - Created `src/styles` for CSS files
    - Moved `styles.css` into styles directory
    - Updated all asset references
    - Updated project documentation

## Active Decisions
1. **Architecture Decisions**
   - Using vanilla JavaScript for maximum flexibility
   - Module-based code organization
   - Event-driven architecture
   - Local storage for persistence

2. **Implementation Approach**
   - Base node system with inheritance
   - Centralized event management
   - Component-based UI structure
   - Canvas-based rendering

## Current Considerations
1. **Technical Setup**
   - Project structure organization
   - Module dependency management
   - Development workflow
   - Testing approach

2. **Implementation Details**
   - Node type system design
   - Event system architecture
   - UI component integration
   - State management strategy

## Next Steps
1. **Immediate Tasks**
   - Review and validate memory bank documentation
   - Set up development environment
   - Implement core node system
   - Create basic UI framework

2. **Upcoming Work**
   - Develop event system
   - Implement node types
   - Create UI components
   - Set up state persistence

## Known Issues
- None currently identified (project in initial setup)

## Questions to Address
1. **Architecture**
   - Optimal event system design
   - State management approach
   - Node type extensibility
   - UI component organization

2. **Implementation**
   - Performance optimization strategies
   - Testing methodology
   - Error handling approach
   - Security considerations

## Current Status
- Project: Initial Setup
- Phase: Documentation
- Priority: High
- Progress: Early Stage
