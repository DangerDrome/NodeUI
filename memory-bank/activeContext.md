## Current Focus
The current focus is on improving the project's CSS architecture by separating icon definitions from component styles. This refactoring will enhance maintainability, readability, and scalability of the stylesheets.

## Recent Changes
- **Refactored CSS**: Separated `icons.css` and `components.css` from the main `styles.css` file.
- **Consolidated icon styles**: All icon-related CSS is now in `icons.css`.
- **Consolidated component styles**: All component-related CSS is now in `components.css`.

## Active Decisions
- Keep a clean separation between icon and component styles.
- Ensure all new styles are added to the appropriate file.

## Next Steps
- Continue to identify and refactor any monolithic files.
- Update documentation to reflect the new CSS structure.

## Known Issues
- None.

## Current Status
