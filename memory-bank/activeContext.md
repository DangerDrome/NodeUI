# Active Context

## Current Focus
The NodeUI refactoring has been **successfully completed**. The monolithic `nodeui.js` file has been successfully split into focused, maintainable classes while preserving all functionality. The application is fully functional with all features working correctly, including the recently fixed routing cut functionality.

## Recent Changes
- **Successfully completed the NodeUI refactoring** - split the 1764-line monolithic file into focused classes
- **Created specialized handler classes**:
  - `CanvasRenderer` - handles all canvas rendering, SVG operations, and visual updates
  - `FileHandler` - manages file operations, save/load, drag & drop, and screenshots
  - `ContextMenuHandler` - handles context menu display and edge editing
  - `NodeManager` - manages node/edge lifecycle, updates, and grouping
  - `SelectionManager` - handles selection, clipboard, and multi-select operations
  - `InteractionHandler` - manages all mouse/touch/keyboard interactions
  - `DragHandler` - handles drag operations, grouping logic, and edge splitting
  - `EdgeDrawingHandler` - handles edge drawing and connection logic
  - `RoutingHandler` - handles routing cut and edge routing operations
- **Maintained full functionality** - all features work exactly as before the refactor
- **Fixed routing cut functionality** - 'r + drag' now works correctly, starting at proper mouse position
- **Fixed grouping functionality** - 'g' key now works correctly for grouping selected nodes

## Active Decisions
1. **Architecture Decisions**
   - Successfully implemented class-based separation of concerns
   - Maintained event-driven architecture throughout refactor
   - Preserved all existing functionality while improving code organization
   - Used delegation pattern to maintain clean interfaces

2. **Implementation Approach**
   - Incremental refactoring approach proved successful
   - Each extraction was tested immediately to ensure no regressions
   - Maintained backward compatibility with existing event system
   - Preserved all user interactions and visual feedback

## Current Considerations
1. **Code Quality**
   - Significantly improved maintainability through focused classes
   - Reduced cognitive load by separating concerns
   - Maintained performance through efficient delegation
   - Preserved all existing functionality

2. **Future Development**
   - Codebase is now much more extensible
   - New features can be added to appropriate handler classes
   - Testing is easier with focused responsibilities
   - Documentation is clearer with logical separation

## Next Steps
- **Monitor for any edge cases** that might not have been tested
- **Consider additional optimizations** now that code is better organized
- **Plan for new features** with the improved architecture
- **Document the new architecture** for future development

## Known Issues
- **None** - all functionality is working correctly after refactor
- Routing cut functionality was fixed and now works properly with 'r + drag'
- Grouping functionality was fixed and is now working properly
- All user interactions, visual feedback, and edge cases preserved

## Questions to Address
1. **Architecture**
   - How to best extend the new class-based architecture?
   - What additional handlers might be beneficial?
   - How to optimize inter-handler communication?

2. **Implementation**
   - Are there any performance optimizations possible with the new structure?
   - How to best add new node types with the current architecture?
   - What testing strategies work best with the new separation?

## Current Status
- **Project**: NodeUI Refactor - **COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY**
- **Phase**: Complete
- **Priority**: Complete
- **Progress**: 100% - All functionality preserved and improved
