# Progress Tracking

## What Works
1. **Complete NodeUI Application**
   - All node types (Base, Group, Log, Routing, Settings) fully functional
   - Edge creation and management working perfectly
   - Context menu system with all operations
   - Properties panel for node configuration
   - Event handling system with full functionality
   - Database integration for persistence
   - Logging system for operations
   - All user interactions, drag, and selection logic handled by InteractionHandler
   - Drag functionality fully working and tested
   - Routing cut functionality working correctly - 'r + drag' creates routing nodes

2. **Stable Architecture**
   - Successfully completed NodeUI refactoring - split monolithic file into focused modules
   - CanvasRenderer class - handles all canvas rendering, SVG operations, visual updates
   - FileHandler class - manages file operations, save/load, drag & drop, screenshots
   - ContextMenuHandler class - handles context menu display and edge editing
   - NodeManager class - manages node/edge lifecycle, updates, and grouping
   - InteractionHandler class - manages all mouse/touch/keyboard interactions, drag, and selection
   - EdgeHandler class - handles edge drawing and routing
   - NodeUI core class - orchestrates all handlers and maintains state

3. **Project Structure**
   - Clean, modular file organization
   - Logical separation of concerns
   - Comprehensive documentation
   - Memory bank system for project tracking
   - CSS properly organized into separate files (styles.css, variables.css, icons.css, components.css)

4. **SubGraph System**:
   - **Stable Core**: The `SubGraphNode` is now a stable feature, allowing for the creation of nested, self-contained graphs.
   - **Robust Navigation**: Full graph context navigation is implemented with a stable breadcrumb system that correctly handles multi-level traversal.
   - **Reliable State Management**: State is correctly preserved when entering, exiting, and navigating between subgraphs, preventing data corruption.
   - **High-Quality Previews**: Thumbnails are rendered as crisp, automatically-framed SVG images that reflect the subgraph's content and the node's color.
   - **File Integration**: Subgraphs can be created from dropped JSON files, and their state is saved with the main graph.

## Current Status
- **Project**: NodeUI
- **Phase**: Maintenance & Refinement
- **Progress**: 95% - Core systems are complete and stable. Current work is focused on refining advanced features like the SubGraph system.
- **SubGraph Implementation**: 95% complete
  - ✅ Core SubGraph node class
  - ✅ Robust graph context navigation
  - ✅ Stable breadcrumb navigation
  - ✅ High-quality SVG preview rendering
  - ✅ State persistence during navigation
  - ✅ Context menu integration
  - ✅ File management (drag-and-drop creation)
  - ⏳ Functional data flow for exposed attributes
  - ⏳ Advanced SubGraph library/template features

## What's Left to Build
- **Advanced SubGraph Features**: 
  - Implement robust data flow for exposed attributes.
  - Design and build a `SubGraph` template/library system for easy reuse.
- **Enhanced UI Features**:
  - Properties panel for advanced node configuration.
  - `SubGraph`-specific context menu options (e.g., managing exposed attributes).
- **Advanced Features**:
  - Undo/redo system.
  - Node templates.
  - Plugin system.

## Known Issues
- **Exposed Attribute Data Flow**: The mechanism for passing data in and out of subgraphs via exposed handles is not yet fully implemented.
- **Manual SubGraph Saving**: `SubGraph` content is updated in memory, but saving a `SubGraph` as a separate, reusable `.json` file is still a manual user action.

## Testing Status
- ✅ **Functional testing** - All features working
- ✅ **User interaction testing** - All interactions preserved
- ✅ **Edge case testing** - All edge cases working
- ✅ **Performance testing** - No performance degradation
- ✅ **Browser compatibility** - Working across browsers
- ✅ **Routing cut testing** - Working correctly
- ✅ **SubGraph Navigation** - Core navigation and state management are tested and stable.

## Documentation Status
- ✅ Project brief
- ✅ Technical context
- ✅ System patterns
- ✅ Active context
- ✅ Progress tracking
- ✅ Architecture documentation

## Architecture Summary
The NodeUI application has been successfully refactored from a monolithic file into a clean, maintainable architecture with focused classes:

- **NodeUI** (core orchestration)
- **CanvasRenderer** (visual rendering)
- **FileHandler** (file operations)
- **ContextMenuHandler** (context menus)
- **NodeManager** (node lifecycle)
- **InteractionHandler** (user interactions, drag, and selection)
- **EdgeHandler** (edge drawing and routing)

All functionality is preserved, code is more maintainable, and the architecture is ready for future development. 

## Recent Achievements
- Successfully implemented and stabilized the `SubGraph` node type.
- Fixed all known bugs related to nested navigation and state persistence.
- Refactored `SubGraph` previews from canvas to SVG for improved quality and scaling.
- Streamlined the breadcrumb navigation system for intuitive traversal of nested graphs.
- Implemented robust, deep-copy-based state serialization to prevent context-related bugs.
