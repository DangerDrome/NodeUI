# Progress Tracking

## What Works
1. **Complete NodeUI Application**
   - All node types (Base, Group, Log, Routing, Settings, SubGraph, ThreeJS) fully functional
   - Edge creation and management working perfectly
   - Context menu system with all operations
   - Properties panel for node configuration
   - Event handling system with full functionality
   - Database integration for persistence
   - Logging system for operations
   - All user interactions, drag, and selection logic handled by InteractionHandler
   - Drag functionality fully working and tested
   - Routing cut functionality working correctly - 'r + drag' creates routing nodes
   - **Performance Optimized**: Implemented comprehensive optimizations to eliminate flickering and improve rendering performance.
   - **Conditional Animation**: Animation loops only run when needed (during interaction or timeline playback).
   - **Render Optimization**: Intelligent render state tracking prevents unnecessary renders when scene is static.
   - **GPU Acceleration**: CSS optimizations and WebGL configurations for smooth 3D rendering.
   - **Advanced Timeline UI**: A completely new, interactive timeline UI has been implemented with a resizable multi-panel layout, interactive ruler, playhead, and range controls.
   - **Keyframe Management**: Full keyframe interactivity including selection, multi-selection (Shift+Click, Marquee), dragging, copy/paste, insertion (`I` key), and deletion (`Delete` key).
   - **Interactive Action Clips**: Summary action clips in the timeline can be dragged to move an entire animation or resized to adjust its duration.
   - **Animation Playback**: The timeline now drives the animation in the 3D viewport, with keyframe values being interpolated and applied to 3D objects in real-time.
   - **Dynamic Node Connections**: The `ThreeJSNode` now automatically detects connected nodes and displays them in the outliner and 3D scene.
   - **3D Text Rendering**: Connected notes are now rendered as true 3D text meshes in the viewport.

2. **Stable Architecture**
   - Successfully completed NodeUI refactoring - split monolithic file into focused modules
   - CanvasRenderer class - handles all canvas rendering, SVG operations, visual updates
   - FileHandler class - manages file operations, save/load, drag & drop, screenshots
   - ContextMenuHandler class - handles context menu display and edge editing
   - NodeManager class - manages node/edge lifecycle, updates, and grouping
   - InteractionHandler class - manages all mouse/touch/keyboard interactions, drag, and selection
   - EdgeHandler class - handles edge drawing and routing
   - NodeUI core class - orchestrates all handlers and maintains state

3. **Project Structure**
   - Clean, modular file organization
   - Logical separation of concerns
   - Comprehensive documentation
   - Memory bank system for project tracking
   - CSS properly organized into separate files (styles.css, variables.css, icons.css, components.css)

4. **SubGraph System**:
   - **Stable Core**: The `SubGraphNode` is now a stable feature, allowing for the creation of nested, self-contained graphs.
   - **Robust Navigation**: Full graph context navigation is implemented with a stable breadcrumb system that correctly handles multi-level traversal.
   - **Reliable State Management**: State is correctly preserved when entering, exiting, and navigating between subgraphs, preventing data corruption.
   - **High-Quality Previews**: Thumbnails are rendered as crisp, automatically-framed SVG images that reflect the subgraph's content and the node's color.
   - **File Integration**: Subgraphs can be created from dropped JSON files, and their state is saved with the main graph.

5. **3D Viewport System**:
   - **`ThreeJSNode` Core**: The `ThreeJSNode` is a stable feature providing an integrated 3D viewport.
   - **Interactive Scene**: Renders a default scene with grid/axis helpers and responds to interactive camera controls.
   - **Timeline UI**: Includes a functional timeline with play/pause and frame scrubbing controls.
   - **Dynamic Resizing**: The viewport automatically and efficiently resizes with the node.
   - **Performance Optimized**: Implemented comprehensive optimizations to eliminate flickering and improve rendering performance.
   - **Conditional Animation**: Animation loops only run when needed (during interaction or timeline playback).
   - **Render Optimization**: Intelligent render state tracking prevents unnecessary renders when scene is static.
   - **GPU Acceleration**: CSS optimizations and WebGL configurations for smooth 3D rendering.
   - **Advanced Timeline UI**: A completely new, interactive timeline UI has been implemented with a resizable multi-panel layout, interactive ruler, playhead, and range controls.
   - **Keyframe Management**: Full keyframe interactivity including selection, multi-selection (Shift+Click, Marquee), dragging, copy/paste, insertion (`I` key), and deletion (`Delete` key).
   - **Interactive Action Clips**: Summary action clips in the timeline can be dragged to move an entire animation or resized to adjust its duration.
   - **Animation Playback**: The timeline now drives the animation in the 3D viewport, with keyframe values being interpolated and applied to 3D objects in real-time.
   - **Dynamic Node Connections**: The `ThreeJSNode` now automatically detects connected nodes and displays them in the outliner and 3D scene.
   - **3D Text Rendering**: Connected notes are now rendered as true 3D text meshes in the viewport.

## Known Issues
- **Exposed Attribute Data Flow**: The mechanism for passing data in and out of subgraphs via exposed handles is not yet fully implemented.
- **Manual SubGraph Saving**: `SubGraph` content is updated in memory, but saving a `SubGraph` as a separate, reusable `.json` file is still a manual user action.
- **3D Content Loading**: No 3D model loading functionality implemented yet.

## Architecture Summary
The NodeUI application has been successfully refactored from a monolithic file into a clean, maintainable architecture with focused classes:
