# Progress Tracking

## What Works
1. **Complete NodeUI Application**
   - All node types (Base, Group, Log, Routing, Settings) fully functional
   - Edge creation and management working perfectly
   - Context menu system with all operations
   - Properties panel for node configuration
   - Event handling system with full functionality
   - Database integration for persistence
   - Logging system for operations
   - **All user interactions, drag, and selection logic handled by InteractionHandler**
   - **All references to DragHandler removed**
   - **Drag functionality fully restored and tested**
   - **Routing cut functionality working correctly** - 'r + drag' creates routing nodes

2. **Refactored Architecture**
   - **Successfully completed NodeUI refactoring** - split 1764-line monolithic file
   - **CanvasRenderer class** - handles all canvas rendering, SVG operations, visual updates
   - **FileHandler class** - manages file operations, save/load, drag & drop, screenshots
   - **ContextMenuHandler class** - handles context menu display and edge editing
   - **NodeManager class** - manages node/edge lifecycle, updates, and grouping
   - **InteractionHandler class** - manages all mouse/touch/keyboard interactions, drag, and selection
   - **EdgeHandler class** - handles edge drawing and routing
   - **NodeUI core class** - orchestrates all handlers and maintains state

3. **Project Structure**
   - Clean, modular file organization
   - Logical separation of concerns
   - Comprehensive documentation
   - Memory bank system for project tracking

## Refactor Progress
- **COMPLETE**: All phases of NodeUI refactoring
  - All functionality preserved and working correctly
  - All drag and selection logic now handled by InteractionHandler
  - All references to DragHandler removed
  - Drag functionality fully restored and tested
- **COMPLETE**: CSS Refactoring
  - Separated `icons.css` and `components.css` from `styles.css`
  - All icon-related styles are now in `icons.css`
  - All component-related styles are now in `components.css`

## What's Left to Build
- **Nothing** - All core systems are complete and working

## Known Issues
- **None** - All functionality working correctly after refactor

## Current Status
- **Project**: NodeUI Refactor - **COMPLETE & STABLE**
- **Phase**: Maintenance
- **Progress**: 100% - All functionality preserved and improved

## Testing Status
- ✅ **Functional testing** - All features working
- ✅ **User interaction testing** - All interactions preserved
- ✅ **Edge case testing** - All edge cases working
- ✅ **Performance testing** - No performance degradation
- ✅ **Browser compatibility** - Working across browsers
- ✅ **Routing cut testing** - Working correctly

## Documentation Status
- ✅ Project brief
- ✅ Technical context
- ✅ System patterns
- ✅ Active context
- ✅ Progress tracking
- ✅ **Refactored architecture documentation**

## Architecture Summary
The NodeUI application has been successfully refactored from a monolithic 1764-line file into a clean, maintainable architecture with focused classes:

- **NodeUI** (core orchestration)
- **CanvasRenderer** (visual rendering)
- **FileHandler** (file operations)
- **ContextMenuHandler** (context menus)
- **NodeManager** (node lifecycle)
- **InteractionHandler** (user interactions, drag, and selection)
- **EdgeHandler** (edge drawing and routing)
- **NodeUI core class** - orchestrates all handlers and maintains state

All functionality is preserved, code is more maintainable, and the architecture is ready for future development.
